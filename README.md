# Project Breakpoint

Project Breakpoint is a project of mine to gather resources on web development into one central location.  The idea is to have everything I find useful together in a manner that is searchable and useful.  This website will include links to tutorials, reference pages, web tools and anything else that might come in handy.  Most of these things are the works of other people, not myself, I'm simply creating a bucket to put them into.

I don't intend to make this website with any frameworks or libraries.  Right now, Sass and vanilla JS should do the trick.  I was originally going to throw Bootstrap on it, but I think I'll just use flex box and my own custom styling.

The older Project Breakpoint has been archived, I desired to change the look of the webpage, as well as it's functionality, which required a bit of an overhaul.  There is a focus on web development, but I'll be putting what resources I've gathered for programming and app development as well.  App development is focused on Apple, since I know a bit about Swift and XCode, but nothing about Android.
